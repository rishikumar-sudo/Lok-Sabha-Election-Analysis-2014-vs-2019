# Lok Sabha Election Analysis: 2014 vs 2019

Welcome to the Lok Sabha Election Analysis project! This repository contains the code and resources used to analyze the Lok Sabha election results for the years 2014 and 2019. This project is part of the Resume Challenge Project 11 by Codebasics.

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to provide a detailed examination of electoral trends, voting patterns, and key metrics across India's parliamentary constituencies during the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. We aim to enrich public understanding of the electoral process in India and highlight key insights that have shaped the country's democracy over these years.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
- **Excel**: For initial data exploration and cleaning.
- **Python**: For data cleaning, transformation, and advanced analytics.

## Data

- **Source**: Election data for 2014 and 2019 was sourced from the Election Commission of India.
- **Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized constituency names.
- **Transformation**: Merged datasets from 2014 and 2019 for comparative analysis, created additional columns for derived metrics.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Winning Candidate and Party**: Identification of winning candidates and their respective parties for each constituency.
- **Voter Turnout**: Calculation of voter turnout percentage at the national and state levels.
- **Vote Share**: Analysis of vote share distribution among parties.
- **Margin of Victory**: Measurement of the vote margin between winning candidates and runners-up.
